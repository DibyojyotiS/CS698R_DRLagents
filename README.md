# Deep-RL
A repo for my deep RL agents!

The agents implemented here are:
1. NFQ
2. DQN
3. Double DQN (DDQN)
4. Dueling DDQN (D3QN)
5. Dueling DDQN with Prioritized Experience Replay (D3QN_PER)

More over there is the replay buffer, which implements the Usual experience replay as well as the Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)

To know more about the inputs (and the documentation) please read the class descriptions.
The documentation is comming in the Readme in a while
